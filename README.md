Make a meme discord bot in Java

To make a Discord bot in Java, you will need to use the Discord API and a Java library for interacting with the API, such as JDA (Java Discord API). Here are the steps you can follow to create a Discord bot in Java:

1. First, create a new Discord account for your bot if you don't already have one.

2. Go to the Discord Developer Portal (https://discord.com/developers/applications/) and create a new application. Give your application a name, and then click on the "Create" button.

3. Click on the "Create a Bot" button in the sidebar on the left. This will create a new bot for your application.

4. Click on the "Copy" button next to the "TOKEN" field to copy your bot's token to your clipboard. This token will be used to authenticate your bot with the Discord API.

5. Next, you will need to install a Java library for interacting with the Discord API. One option is JDA (Java Discord API), which can be found at https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA. To install JDA, you will need to add it as a dependency to your project.

**NOTE:** If you're gonna use Maven then you will need to add the sample code given in your `pom.xml`
